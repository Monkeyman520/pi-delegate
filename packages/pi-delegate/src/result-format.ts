const HANDOFF_INSTRUCTIONS = `Result reporting convention (advisory):
Explicit task-specific output requirements take precedence over this convention. If they conflict (for example, return only JSON), follow those requirements instead of adding handoff sections.
Otherwise, finish with a concise, readable handoff covering:
- Completion: completed work and main conclusions; separately state unfinished work or remaining scope.
- Changes: changed file paths with short descriptions, or explicitly state no file changes.
- Deliverables: available commit references, patch paths or other artifact paths, or explicitly state none are available.
- Verification: checks actually performed, their commands and results; checks not performed and the reasons.
- Blockers and decisions: blockers and decisions needed from the parent, with options/recommendation when applicable, or explicitly state none are needed.
Report facts only: unknown information is unknown, unperformed checks are unperformed, and unavailable artifacts are unavailable. Do not invent paths, results or completion claims to fill sections. Analysis/review/testing tasks need not change files or use Git.
This convention grants no extra permission for file edits, commits, patch generation or other artifact creation; act only within the actual task's authorized scope.
The report is a navigation aid, not an integration artifact or proof of correctness, passing checks or acceptance. The parent owns artifact inspection, acceptance, integration and necessary validation. This is a reporting request, not an enforced schema.`;
